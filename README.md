# gdxAnimation

gdxAnimation is a library letting you render your Spriter animations at runtime in the LibGDX game engine. You can easily alter or copy the animations during runtime to customize your animations per example.

The goal of this library isn't to be a port for Spriter on LibGDX but to offer a clean and nice way to manage your animations in LibGDX. For now, it only supports Spriter but I plan to support new ways to load animations in the future. You can also create all your animations in the code or make your own animation loader that fills the Animation class.

## Trixt0r/spriter

Originally forked from https://github.com/Trixt0r/spriter, gdxAnimation has a different goal than its original fork. The giant changes in the whole structure and the usage of LibGDX explains why it is no longer a fork. Lots of features have been removed to better aim the goal of this library.

## Spriter

Spriter is a partially free (some features requires a premium licence) 2D animator compatible with many game engines. I do not work for Spriter but I've been using it personnally.
